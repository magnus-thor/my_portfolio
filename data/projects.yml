  description: This is the final project for the August 2017 cohort.

               We were approched by a client who wanted a website for a restaurant, where customers can order food online and pick it up at the restaurant after 30 minutes.

               The frontend for the project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.5.0. In the first release we put focus on the basic requirement for a functional website, while still aiming to fit the clients conditions regarding the styling. A customer can visit the website and get restaurant information, choose a dish with a specific ingredient, and pay for the order. After an order is placed and paid for, the kitchen receives an email with pick up and order details.
